Above shows three maps of New York City separated by Community District blocks with the colors depicting the percentage of waste collected in 2016. It is separated into Refuse Waste, Paper Waste and Metal-Glass-Plastic (MGP) Waste. The amount was classified using a quantile scheme break.

To calculate for the percentage, the amount of waste collected per category was divided by the total amount of waste collected for the community district.

It is interesting to see that compared to the rest of the city, Lower Manhattan has a relatively lower percentage of refuse waste and a higher percentage of paper and MGP waste.

Above shows the trend of the waste collected per borough (also in percentages).

It shows that the amount of refuse waste collected seems to decrease a little over the years with a slight increase in the paper and MGP waste. It is also interesting to see that the Bronx has more MGP waste than paper wherein in all other boroughs, there is more paper waste than MGP waste.

## HW8_uc288_review

There are 4 plots that Unisse made.The first third plot is a map and the second one is bar plot to show the trend.

**CLARITY**: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?
> The map

**ESTHETIC**: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?
> 

**HONESTY**: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?
