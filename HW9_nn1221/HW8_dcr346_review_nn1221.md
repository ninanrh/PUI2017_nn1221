## HW8_dcr346 Creating a Plot Assignment

# Permit Issuance by Permit Type and Borough
Worked alone on this assignment.

The objective of this assignment was to get a picture of the urban development level / situation of the city by viewing the amount of permits issued, categorically seperated by permit types, for each of all 5 New York City's boroughs. Data were retrieved from [CUSP Data Facility DOB permit issuance data](http://urbanprofiler.cloudapp.net/dataset/ipu4-2q9a/)

For the code used to generate the following plot please see the attached [Ipython Notebook](https://github.com/danachermesh/PUI2017_dcr346/blob/master/HW8_dcr346/HW8_dcr346.ipynb)

### Fig.1 Permit Issuance by Permit Type and Borough, years 2015-2017
It is clear that **Brooklyn** and **Queens** are relatively more developing and / or changing, with large numbers of permits from the three selected types. These two boroughs have also the highest numbers of _New Buildings_ permissions, as well as _demolishings_ (= Earthwork). **Manhattan**, which we know is also facing a rapidly urban development, seems to experience it more in the building _Alternations_ level rather than in new constructions. This makes sense due to the lack of free space in Manhattan and its high density urban areas. **Staten Island** and **Bronx** are the less developing botoughs of the city, as we could have guessed.
