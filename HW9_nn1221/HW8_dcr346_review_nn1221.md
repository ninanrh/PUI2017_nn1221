## HW8_dcr346 Creating a Plot Assignment

# Permit Issuance by Permit Type and Borough
Worked alone on this assignment.

The objective of this assignment was to get a picture of the urban development level / situation of the city by viewing the amount of permits issued, categorically seperated by permit types, for each of all 5 New York City's boroughs. Data were retrieved from [CUSP Data Facility DOB permit issuance data](http://urbanprofiler.cloudapp.net/dataset/ipu4-2q9a/)

For the code used to generate the following plot please see the attached [Ipython Notebook](https://github.com/danachermesh/PUI2017_dcr346/blob/master/HW8_dcr346/HW8_dcr346.ipynb)

### Fig.1 Permit Issuance by Permit Type and Borough, years 2015-2017
It is clear that **Brooklyn** and **Queens** are relatively more developing and / or changing, with large numbers of permits from the three selected types. These two boroughs have also the highest numbers of _New Buildings_ permissions, as well as _demolishings_ (= Earthwork). **Manhattan**, which we know is also facing a rapidly urban development, seems to experience it more in the building _Alternations_ level rather than in new constructions. This makes sense due to the lack of free space in Manhattan and its high density urban areas. **Staten Island** and **Bronx** are the less developing botoughs of the city, as we could have guessed.

### CLARITY 
> is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?

- The plot is very easy to read and very clear.
- One slight problem is the title said the data from 2015-2017, I was a bit confused because I assumed there was 2015, 2016, 2017 data, so it must be the sum of the data. I would add "Total" word in the title -> "Total Permit Issuance by Permit Type and Borough, years 2015-2017" so it won't be misleading.


### ESTHETIC
> beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?

- The color looks fine and works on all color blindness type. Great job! I honestly like the color.
- The minor problem here is the x axis label rotation somehow is too much. There is some spaces left if you don't change the rotation and I think will works just fine. 


### HONESTY
> is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?
- The plot is reproducing the data honestly as the y axis shows.
